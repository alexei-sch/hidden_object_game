Hidden Object
==================

It's just a sample task of a "hidden object" game. Not a production application. 
To build you need Qt 4.5 and MSVC 2008 installed.
Using c++ and Qt 4.5 as a primary library and qmake as a build tool.
Entire application is divided into independent dll modules (app, core, gui, db, resources).
Test Runner based on qt tests implemented. Every dll has its own suite of tests.
